			<p>My name is mubshar khan and i am responsible for the Navigation which allows users to move around the page more easily as they can just use the links. it will redirect them to the correct pages. These links have been set using the links provided from the servers.  This has the same style throughout my other pages. i have also been in charge of making the query form which allows users to voice their queries usinh a simple form that i have created. This form allows users to enter their name email pick a theme for their query and any additional things they want to say. This is essential as our group has a buy products page and any problems or information they require can be gained using our query page. i have also been in charge of creating an external css for my group to use and for myself.
