			<p>Football is one of the most popular sports around the world. It consists of two teams scoring against each other in a given time frame. There are two halfs which both are 45 minutes each. The aim of both teams is to either defend or attack the opposite teams goals. There are 11 players in both  teams and there can be a few subsitiutes in case some of them get injured while playing. This is very useful as some players can be subbed off and a fresh player can play one half and another can play the second.</p>

			<p>Skills in football such as dribbling and passing the ball are key as that is one of the main ways of progressing through the game. This is the way a formation can be used to progress the game forward. These can be developed using drills such as using cones to run inbetween or use cones to pass the balls to in case there isnt a person available to assist you with it.</p>

			<h1 id="cricket">Cricket what is it?</h1>

			<p> Cricket is a very interesting and hard sport. There are many different formats which you are able to play cricket but the most loved is  test cricket. This is the oldest format where both teams dress up in white clothes and face eachother in an unlimited over game. This means  if a team is put into bat they will have the chance to score as many runs as they can and after they are satisfied with the amount of runs they have made or been  bowled out they can declare innings and let the other team chase down the amount of runs. Cricket requires agility speed and quick arm action.</p>

			<p> Agility is gained through regular training and a scheduled day. A cricketer should stick to a strict routine when they are in camp for training. This is essential in being a successful player because these steps help develop skills. Something as small as healthy diet can improve agility eating the correct  foods can help give that extra boost in a players confidence. Speed is important for both the batsmen and bowlers. This is because they may need to chase the ball or run inbetween the wickets. A quick arm action is important again for everyone because a bowler can speed the ball up to put off the batsmen or the  batsmen can use this speed to hit the ball harder. This can be developed through practicing drills such as the certain arm actions used to do certain types of actions.</p>
